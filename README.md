Context: Chrome or Firefox browser.

As a player I want

 	* to see a character entity on the browser screen
 	* to move the entity with the arrow keys
 	* the character entity to experience gravity
 	* the background canvas to scroll to simulate falling
 	* the falling to be enforced by a sliding window
 	* to see points in the bottom of the screen starting with 0
 	* to see hearts in the bottom of the screen showing health
 	* to gain points by collecting artifacts
 	* to avoid pillows which I bounce off of ( visual effect the feathers explode )
 	* to avoid piles / platforms of books which stop me from falling
 	* to gain speed by grabbing an anchor

 	* to avoid flying monkeys with bat wings
 	* to grab donouts to give me points
