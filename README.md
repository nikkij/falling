# falling
A Javascript game

# Quick Story Breakdown
Context: Chrome or Firefox browser.

As a player I want
* to see a canvas that fills the browser screen
* to see a character entity on the browser screen
* to move the entity with the arrow keys
* the character entity to experience gravity
* the background canvas to scroll to simulate falling
* the falling to be enforced by a sliding window
* to see points in the bottom of the screen starting with 0
* to see hearts in the bottom of the screen showing health
* to gain points by collecting artifacts
* to avoid pillows which I bounce off of ( visual effect the feathers explode )
* to avoid piles / platforms of books which stop me from falling
* to gain speed by grabbing an anchor
* to loose speed by grabbing an umbrella
* to avoid flying monkeys with bat wings
* to grab donouts to give me points
* to grab coffee to restore health

4/24:
* Added npm, grunt and jasmine support
* Added 1 currently failing test
* To run tests from command line root dir:  grunt test
